## What is a system?
--> Many components that work together to achieve a particular purpose <br>
--> Types of systems:
* fabricated system:
* natural system:

## characteristics of system: (9 characteristics)

--> Constraint
* Limit of what a system can accomplish

--> Input
* Whatever system takes from the environment.

--> Output
* Whatever system returns to the environment.

## Decomposition
* Break down a system in its components

## Modularity
* Divide components into modules of equal sizes

## Coupling
* Subsystems are as independent as possible

## Cohesion
* Each function should do a single task

## What is an OS?
* System can be divided into 2 parts:
    * Machine part
    * Operating system part
